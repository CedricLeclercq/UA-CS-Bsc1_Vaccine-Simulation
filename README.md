Vaccination Distribution Simulator

Made by CÃ©dric Leclercq and Maarten Peirsman

## Guidelines

**Ensure the working directory is set to the root of the project when running in CLion**           
*(For windows users: set working directory to '..', on mac this should be the default)* 

* This program requires at least one argument; the file containing the information about the Vaccination Simulation
* The second, optional, argument is the output stream (provide a filename as a second argument). If no second argument is given, the program will output to the console
  
* A graphical Representation of each simulation day can be found in the "CGI" folder. Please clear these files (rm ./CGI/*) before starting a new simulation
